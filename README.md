# To-Do Cloud App 

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It saves your tasks in the browser using **localStorage**, so they stay even after you close or refresh the page.

I created this project to practice core front-end skills and understand how basic cloud hosting works using AWS and GitHub.
